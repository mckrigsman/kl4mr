# KL4MR - A KiCad Library for Model Railroading
This is a collection of KiCad symbols and footprints focused around common DCC decoders (and other simialr gadgets) used in the model railroading industry.

All symbols and footprints within this library are made using a combination of resources including but not limited to [RCN](https://www.railcommunity.org/), [NEM](https://www.morop.org/) and [NMRA](https://www.nmra.org/) standards. Best practices recommended by [KiCad Library Convention (KLC)](https://klc.kicad.org/) guidelines have also been followed where possible.

## Supported decoders

Following decoder footprints are currently included:

* MTC21
* PluX21
* PluX16
* E24

More decoders, board layouts and other gadgets are likely to be added as time goes on.

## Installation

Currently the preferred way of install is by using the KiCad plugin and content manager:

`KiCad -> Plugin and Content Manager -> Install from File...`
