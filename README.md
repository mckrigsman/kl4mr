# KL4MR - KiCad Library for Model Railroading
This KiCad library is a collection of symbols and footprints focused around DCC decoders (and other similar gadgets) commonly used in the model railroading industry.

All contents were made using a combination of resources including but not limited to [RCN](https://www.railcommunity.org/), [NEM](https://www.morop.org/) and [NMRA](https://www.nmra.org/) standards. Best practices found in the [KiCad Library Convention](https://klc.kicad.org/) guidelines have also been followed where possible.

## Supported decoder standards

Following decoder footprints are currently included:

* PluX21
* PluX16

More decoders will be added in the future!

## How to install

It's simple, really! Just follow these steps and you should be all good to go:

Step 1: Download the latest release.

Step 2: Navigate to `KiCad -> Plugin and Content Manager -> Install from File...`

Step 3: Select the `.zip` file you just downloaded.

Step 4: Make sure that you can find this library under the `Installed` tab in your `Plugin and Content Manager`.

*Only KiCad versions 9.0 and above are currently supported. While I see no reason why these wouldn't work with older versions, I have not yet been able to test this for myself, so user discretion is advised!*
