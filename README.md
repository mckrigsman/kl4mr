# KL4MR - KiCad Library for Model Railroading
This KiCad library is a collection of symbols and footprints focused around DCC decoders (and other similar gadgets) commonly used in the model railroading industry.

All symbols and footprints were made using a combination of resources including but not limited to [RCN](https://www.railcommunity.org/), [NEM](https://www.morop.org/) and [NMRA](https://www.nmra.org/) standards. Best practices found in the [KiCad Library Convention](https://klc.kicad.org/) guidelines have also been followed where possible.

## Supported decoders

Following decoder footprints are currently included:

* MTC21
* PluX21
* PluX16
* E24

More decoders, board layouts and other gadgets are likely to be added as time goes on.

## How to install

Currently only KiCad versions 9.0 and above are supported! While I see no reason why this wouldn't work with older versions, I have not yet been able to test this out myself so user discretion is advised.

>Step 1: Dowload the latest release.
>
>Step 2: Navigate to `KiCad -> Plugin and Content Manager -> Install from File...`
>
>Step 3: Select the file you just downloaded.
>
>Step 4: Enjoy your new symbols and footprints!
