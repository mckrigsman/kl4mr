# 1 General

## 1.1 Purpose of the Standard

This standard specifies uniform interfaces according to the PluX standard for the safe and rapid installation or replacement of electronic modules (vehicle and function decoders or SUSI modules, hereinafter referred to as decoders) in vehicles for the purpose of control via digital control systems. It essentially corresponds to [[NEM 658]()].

## 1.2 Description of the Interface

The interface supports the connection of one motor, a maximum of nine function outputs, and one sensor input. The installation space and the size of the decoder are part of the interface. Vehicles with a factory-installed interface and decoders with the interface according to this RCN must be clearly marked on the packaging with the designation PluX22 or PluX16.

[[NEM 658]()] also defines a PluX12 interface. This is not recommended for new vehicle designs. However, since many vehicles still use this interface, it is defined in Appendix D. The PluX8 interface, defined by the NMRA in [[S-9.1.1]()], offers no advantages over [[NEM 651]()] and has therefore not been used to date or included in this standard. For correspondingly small vehicles, the Next18 interface is recommended.

The interface is defined for the decoder to be plugged directly into the vehicle. Connection via cable is not provided, and such a design does not comply with this standard.

# 2 Mechanical Properties

The interface consists of a 16- or 22-pin, two-row female connector with a 1.27 mm pitch on the vehicle side and a matching male connector on the decoder side. Interchangeability is achieved by omitting pin 11 and blocking the corresponding female connector. The two designs are designated PluX16 and PluX22 according to the number of contacts, including the index.

The pins have a minimum length of 3 mm and a maximum length of 4 mm and feature either a square profile with an edge length of 0.40 mm or a round profile with a diameter of 0.43 mm. Both pins and female connectors have a gold-plated contact surface and a contact load capacity of up to 1 A.

## 2.1 Decoder Requirements

The maximum dimensions of the decoder are:

* for the PluX22, a maximum of 30 (length) x 16 (width) x 6.0 (height) mm,
* for the PluX16, a maximum of 20 (length) x 11 (width) x 4.2 (height) mm.

Note: The [[NEM 658]()] specifies a length of 35 mm for the PluX22. To harmonize decoder sizes and installation spaces for 21MTC and PluX22, a smaller maximum length is specified here. Also unlike the [[NEM 658]()], there is no PluX16 version with sound that allows for a longer length.

The letters in Figure 1 indicate parts of the decoder or correspond to the following dimensions. Unless otherwise stated, all values ​​are maximum dimensions.

***Table 1:** Dimensions for PluX decoders and mounting space*

Note: For historical reasons, the [RCN-121]() 21MTC and [RCN-122]() PluX use different pin counting methods.

The following image shows a typical pin header.

## 2.2 Vehicle Requirements

The installation space in the vehicle must be designed so that a decoder with maximum dimensions can be inserted without constraints. Sufficient space should also be provided

to allow the decoder to be removed without tools. For compatibility with older decoders manufactured according to [[NEM 658]()] with the different dimensions specified in Appendix C, it is recommended that the installation space in the vehicle be adapted to the dimensions specified there.

The following image shows a typical example of a socket strip.

***Figure 3:** Typical socket strip for vehicles.*

Installation in the vehicle is permitted in two variants.

### 2.2.1 Compact Version

![Placeholder]()

***Figure 4:** Installation in the compact version*

The compact version results in the lowest possible installation height. The decoder pins are inserted through the circuit board in the vehicle into the socket strip on the underside of the vehicle board. The decoder sits flush with the vehicle board. The decoder area on the vehicle board must be kept free of components.

The maximum thickness of the vehicle board for this version is 1 mm. Holes must be provided in the board to allow the pin strip to be inserted through the board from above; however, no hole is required in the board at position 11 of the socket strip for coding. Sufficient space must be provided under the socket strip for the maximum pin length, so that contact with parts of the vehicle chassis or similar is safely excluded.

### 2.2.2 Tall Version

![Placeholder]()

***Figure 5:** Installation in the tall version*

If there is sufficient height but no space for the free space on or for the socket header under the vehicle circuit board, the vehicle manufacturer can install the tall version. In this case, the socket header is located on top of the vehicle circuit board. Here, too, holes must be drilled in the circuit board to provide sufficient space for the decoder pins. Sufficient space must be provided under the vehicle circuit board for the maximum pin length, so that contact with parts of the vehicle chassis or similar is safely excluded.

To ensure that the socket header cannot be mixed up even when installing the tall version, position 11 of the socket header must be completely sealed.
